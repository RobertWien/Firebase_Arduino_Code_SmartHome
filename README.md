# 🔌 ARDUINO SMART HOME CONTROL & MONITORING WITH ESP8266 AND FIREBASE

This is an Arduino project for controlling and monitoring a Smart Home system using an **ESP8266 WiFi module**. The system communicates with a **Firebase Realtime Database** to send and receive data in real-time.

- ✅ **Control:** Devices (like lights, fans, etc.) can be controlled remotely through data commands pushed from a Firebase client (mobile/web app).
- 📡 **Monitoring:** Sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion, etc.) is read by the ESP8266 and sent back to the Firebase server for live monitoring.
